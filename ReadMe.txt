    MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : AccountManagment Project Overview
===============================================================================

The application wizard has created this AccountManagment application for
you.  This application not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft
Foundation Classes but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your AccountManagment application.

AccountManagment.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an application wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    application wizard.

AccountOperation.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    CAccountManagmentApp application class.

AccountManagment.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CTestAccountManagerApp.

AccountManagment.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++. Your project resources are in 1033.

res\AccountManagment.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file TestAccountManager.rc.

res\AccountManagment.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft
    Visual C++. You should place all resources not editable by
    the resource editor in this file.

    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

AccountManagment.manifest
	Application manifest files are used by Windows XP to describe an applications
	dependency on specific versions of Side-by-Side assemblies. The loader uses this
	information to load the appropriate assembly from the assembly cache or private
	from the application. The Application manifest  maybe included for redistribution
	as an external .manifest file that is installed in the same folder as the application
	executable or it may be included in the executable in the form of a resource.
